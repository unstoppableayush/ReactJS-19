 ## Introduction to React.js

 - `JavaScript Library` used for building user interfaces and `single-page applications.`
 - Created by `Jordan Walke` at `Facebook.`
 
## History of React.js

- React.js was open-sourced by `Jordan Walke` and `Tom Occhino` at JSConfUS 2013.
- Initailly faced ciriticism for combining JS and HTML in a single file.

## IS React JS Library or Framework ?

- React is `not framework`. 
- React is a JavaScript library.
- Also known as `ReactJS` and `React.js` 
- known for creating awesome UI.
- React is all about components.

## Why React.js ?

- React is declarative because it describes what the UI should look like rather than how to achieve it.
- This makes the code easier to read and maintain as it is more focused on the end result rather than the steps involved getting there.

- Declarative:
    ```javascript
        function MyComponent({name}){
            return <div>Hello, {name}! </div>
        }
    ```
- Imperative: 
    ```javascript
    function MyComponent(name) {
        const element - document.createElement('div)
        element.textContent = `Hello, ${name}! `;
        return element; 
    }
    ```
    - manually creating elements , setting thier properties and appending them to the DOM.

## How React Works?

- `Component -> Instances -> React Elements (Reconcilation) -> DOM Elements -> Final UI`

## Why React.js over Vanilla Javscript ?

- React.js manages updating the DOM with the components written by us.
